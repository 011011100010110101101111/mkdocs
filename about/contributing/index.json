Contributions can be made in a number of\nways, a few examples are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Code patches via pull requests</li>\n<li>Documentation improvements</li>\n<li>Bug reports and patch reviews</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"reporting-an-issue\">Reporting an Issue<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#reporting-an-issue\" title=\"Permanent link\">\uf0c1</a></h2>\n<p>Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your platform and MkDocs\nversion. If the problem is visual (for example a theme or design issue) please\nadd a screenshot and if you get an error please include the the full error and\ntraceback.</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-the-development-version\">Testing the Development Version<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#testing-the-development-version\" title=\"Permanent link\">\uf0c1</a></h2>\n<p>If you want to just install and try out the latest development version of\nMkDocs you can do so with the following command. This can be useful if you\nwant to provide feedback for a new feature or want to confirm if a bug you\nhave encountered is fixed in the git master. It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended\nthat you do this within a <a href=\"https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide.html\">virtualenv</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">pip install https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/archive/master.tar.gz\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"installing-for-development\">Installing for Development<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#installing-for-development\" title=\"Permanent link\">\uf0c1</a></h2>\n<p>First you'll need to fork and clone the repository. Once you have a local\ncopy, run the following command. It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that you do\nthis within a <a href=\"https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide.html\">virtualenv</a>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"bash\">pip install --editable .\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This will install MkDocs in development mode which binds the <code>mkdocs</code> command\nto the git repository.</p>\n<h2 id=\"running-the-tests\">Running the tests<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#running-the-tests\" title=\"Permanent link\">\uf0c1</a></h2>\n<p>To run the tests, it is recommended that you use <a href=\"https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">Tox</a>. This just needs\nto be pip installed and then the test suite can be ran for MkDocs but running\nthe command <code>tox</code> in the root of your MkDocs repository.</p>\n<p>It will attempt to run the tests against all of the Python versions we\nsupport. So don't be concerned if you are missing some and they fail. The rest\nwill be verified by <a href=\"https://travis-ci.org/repositories\">Travis</a> when you submit a pull request.</p>\n<h2 id=\"submitting-pull-requests\">Submitting Pull Requests<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#submitting-pull-requests\" title=\"Permanent link\">\uf0c1</a></h2>\n<p>Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push\nit to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will\nmost likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.</p>",
